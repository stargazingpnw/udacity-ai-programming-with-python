# AI Programming with Python - Udacity

Projects completed as part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree.

## Projects

### 1. Image Classification for a City Dog Show
Intro to Python for AI section — classifying dog breeds using a pre-trained CNN.

Principal Objectives
1. Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.  
2. Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.  
3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.  
4. Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.

### 2. Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning (Part 1)
Training an image classifier using PyTorch.
This project uses the 102 Category Flower Dataset(https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). To run locally, download the dataset and place it in the flowers/ directory.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:
- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content

### 3. Building the Command Line Application (Part 2)
Converting the classifier into a command-line application.
